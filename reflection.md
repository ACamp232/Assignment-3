# Project Overview
My project uses two APi's to use the name of a place to find the nearest train stop from that location. When prompted the user will input the name of the place they would like to find the nearest stop from. The first API creates a URL using the name of the place that has the location coordinates. Then the program takes the coordinates from the url output and inserts it into another API. THis second API takes the longitude and latitude of the place and gives the nearest station to the location. My project does not deviate from the original requirements. 

## Project Reflection
1. Writing the actual code in python went pretty well. That part took the longest but also was pretty simple because I took it step by step. Using some of the demo code from class and readign the websites helped me through the process. Also, following the project steps made the process so muc easier when I had to combine the seperate functions into one function that executed everything. Combinig all that code for the last function was honestly the easiest prt of the function. Writing the actula website and making it run was the hard part. Even after using the demo code form class and reading the websites on how to use flask I still couldnt debug my website for it work completely. I ran into a lot problems with my [app.py] because I was not too familar with the format. Also small things would make my website dispaly an error message. I thought this would be the part that took the least so I waited a lot longer to do it. 
- **Project Reflection** [~2 paragraphs]
After you finish the project, Please write a short document for reflection [~2 paragraphs]

  1. From a process point of view, what went well? What could you improve? Other possible reflection topics: Was your project appropriately scoped? Did you have a good plan for unit testing? What self-studying did you do? How will you use what you learned going forward? What do you wish you knew before you started that would have helped you succeed?
  2. Also discuss your team process in your reflection. How did you plan to divide the work (e.g. split by module/class, always pair program together, etc.) and how did it actually happen? Were there any issues that arose while working together, and how did you address them? What would you do differently next time?
